The Above index.html is about the simple website created by using html, css and JavaScript.

The website is about to conversion between hex, asci(json) and unknown string

1. unknown: This is an encrypted text string that you need to decode to figure out its
original form.
2. hex: This is a hexadecimal representation of a JSON string in ASCII format and decode
of the unknown string.
3. ascii_text: This is a JSON object represented in ASCII.
All three components (unknown, hex, and ascii_text) are identical in content but differ in their
encoding and display format.

The Task is to Converts hex to unknown or vice versa.

For Example,

● If you convert the hex to ASCII, you will obtain the ascii_text (JSON object).

● If you encode the hex, you will generate the unknown string.

Explanation :-
The length of the unknown string increases in comparison to the hex string.
The conversion method likely involves taking 32 characters of the hex string at a time,
encoding them into an intermediate format, and combining the results into the final
unknown string.
For any remaining characters, additional handling is applied to form the unknown string.
